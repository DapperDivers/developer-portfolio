# Component Development Rules

- ALWAYS use generator command: `yarn generate-component --name=ComponentName --type=[atom|molecule|organism|layout]`
- Follow Atomic Design: atoms, molecules, organisms, layouts
- Required files: TypeScript, CSS module, Storybook, tests
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Implement proper memoization and lazy loading
- Include proper typing and interfaces
- Document usage patterns in Storybook
- Each component must pass accessibility testing
- Performance considerations: optimize bundle size, lazy load when appropriate
- Follow memoization patterns for expensive renders
- Image optimization must be applied
- Components must integrate with AnimationContext
