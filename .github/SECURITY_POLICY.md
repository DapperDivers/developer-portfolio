1. [Reporting Security Issues](#reporting-security-issues)
2. [Disclosure Policy](#disclosure-policy)
3. [Security Update Policy](#security-update-policy)
4. [Security-Related Configuration](#security-related-configuration)
5. [Known Security Gaps and Future Enhancements](#known-security-gaps-and-future-enhancements)

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to security@chelonianlabs.com. You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
* Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
* Prepare fixes for all still-maintained versions of the project.
* Release new security fix versions of the affected versions.

## Security Update Policy

Security updates will be released:

* For critical vulnerabilities - as soon as possible
* For medium severity issues - within 2 weeks
* For low severity issues - within 4 weeks

Updates will be clearly marked in our changelog and release notes.

## Security-Related Configuration

This project implements several security measures:

1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
2. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions
3. Rate limiting
4. Input validation and sanitization
5. Docker security configurations
6. Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Known Security Gaps and Future Enhancements

We believe in transparency. Here are the current security gaps we're aware of and working to address:

1. Implementation of automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Enhanced logging and monitoring
3. Additional penetration testing
4. Security compliance documentation

## Questions

If you have suggestions on how we can improve this policy, please submit a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
