# Navigation Component Enhancement

This document outlines the enhancements made to the Navigation component as part of the portfolio component migration plan. These changes are available in the `feature/navigation-enhanced` branch.

## Key Enhancements

### Functionality Improvements

1. **Section Linking**
   - Added smooth scrolling to sections using `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`
   - Updated URL with section IDs using `window.history.pushState`
   - Set focus on target sections for improved accessibility

2. **Active Section Tracking**
   - Implemented IntersectionObserver to detect which section is currently in view
   - Highlighted active navigation links with visual indicators and aria-current="page"
   - Used rootMargin and threshold options for precise section detection

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Enhanced mobile menu with improved focus management
   - Added proper a11y attributes for screen readers
   - Implemented focus trapping within mobile menu
   - Added escape key handler to close menu

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Applied useCallback for event handlers
   - Implemented useRef for DOM references

### Accessibility Improvements

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Added keyboard focus management for the mobile menu
   - Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Added escape key support for closing the menu

2. **ARIA Attributes**
   - Added aria-label, aria-expanded, and aria-controls attributes
   - Applied role="banner" to header and role="navigation" to navbar
   - Added aria-current="page" to indicate active navigation item

3. **Focus Management**
   - Managed focus when opening/closing mobile menu
   - Set focus on target sections when navigating
   - Preserved scroll position when setting focus using preventScroll

## Implementation Notes

The enhanced Navigation component has been implemented with full feature support, but testing challenges were encountered. The Jest configuration in the project needs to be updated to support:

1. Modern ES module syntax
2. Modern DOM APIs like IntersectionObserver
3. Proper mocking of browser APIs

A basic test file has been created, but full test coverage requires addressing these configuration issues.

## Usage

The enhanced Navigation component can be used like this:

```jsx
<Navigation />
```

It will automatically:
1. Get portfolio data from the PortfolioContext
2. Detect and highlight the active section
3. Provide smooth navigation between sections
4. Adapt to different screen sizes

## Future Improvements

1. **Test Coverage**
   - Add comprehensive tests once Jest configuration is updated
   - Add interaction tests for mobile menu
   - Test scroll and intersection behaviors

2. **Performance Profiling**
   - Add detailed performance measurements
   - Optimize IntersectionObserver usage for large pages

3. **Enhanced Animation**
   - Add subtle animations for section transitions
   - Implement progressive scroll indicators
