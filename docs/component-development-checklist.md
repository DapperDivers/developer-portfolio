# Component Development Checklist

This checklist serves as a guide for creating or updating components in the portfolio project. Following these steps ensures consistency, quality, and proper documentation.

## New Component Creation Checklist

### 1. Planning & Design

- [ ] Identify the atomic design level (atom, molecule, organism, template)
- [ ] Define the component's purpose and responsibility
- [ ] List required props and their types
- [ ] Consider how the component will be used in different contexts
- [ ] Design with accessibility in mind
- [ ] Plan for responsive behavior

### 2. Component Implementation

- [ ] Create the component file with proper naming (PascalCase)
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments
- [ ] Implement PropTypes with descriptions
- [ ] Define default props where appropriate
- [ ] Use design tokens for styling
- [ ] Implement proper accessibility attributes
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Apply performance optimizations (memo, useCallback, etc.)
- [ ] Create component-specific CSS file if needed

### 3. Testing

- [ ] Write basic rendering tests
- [ ] Test prop variations
- [ ] Test user interactions
- [ ] Test accessibility
- [ ] Test responsiveness
- [ ] Test edge cases (empty states, errors, etc.)

### 4. Storybook Documentation

- [ ] Generate story file using the `generate-story.js` script
- [ ] Document basic usage
- [ ] Add stories for all variants and states
- [ ] Include examples for common use cases
- [ ] Document edge cases and limitations
- [ ] Add interaction tests using play functions
- [ ] Set up a11y testing rules
- [ ] Include responsive testing stories

### 5. Final Review

- [ ] Ensure consistent code style
- [ ] Verify all props are documented
- [ ] Check for any hard-coded values that should use design tokens
- [ ] Verify performance optimizations
- [ ] Ensure the component works in all required contexts
- [ ] Test integration with other components
- [ ] Run linting and typechecking

## Component Update Checklist

When updating an existing component, follow these steps:

### 1. Assessment

- [ ] Understand the current implementation
- [ ] Identify what needs to be changed and why
- [ ] Consider impact on other components
- [ ] Review existing tests and stories

### 2. Implementation

- [ ] Make required changes
- [ ] Update JSDoc comments if needed
- [ ] Update PropTypes if adding/changing props
- [ ] Maintain existing behavior unless explicitly changing it
- [ ] Ensure design token usage is consistent

### 3. Testing Updates

- [ ] Update existing tests for new behavior
- [ ] Add tests for new functionality
- [ ] Verify no regressions in existing functionality

### 4. Storybook Updates

- [ ] Update existing stories
- [ ] Add stories for new variants or features
- [ ] Update documentation for changed props or behavior
- [ ] Update interaction tests if behavior changed

### 5. Final Review

- [ ] Ensure changes are backward compatible (or document breaking changes)
- [ ] Verify all new functionality is tested
- [ ] Check for any new edge cases
- [ ] Run linting and typechecking

## Process for Updating Stories When Components Change

When components change, their Storybook stories should be updated to reflect these changes. Follow this process:

1. **Identify affected stories**: Determine which stories need to be updated based on the component changes.

2. **Update stories in parallel**: When making component changes, update the corresponding stories in the same PR.

3. **Test story changes**: Ensure that all stories still work and correctly demonstrate the component's behavior.

4. **Update documentation**: If the component's API or behavior has changed, update the documentation in the story file.

5. **Communicate changes**: Document significant changes in PR descriptions so other team members are aware.

## Using Storybook for Component Changes

Storybook is an excellent tool for developing and testing component changes:

1. **Develop in isolation**: Make changes to components in isolation using Storybook to see immediate feedback.

2. **Test variants**: Use Storybook controls to test different prop combinations and edge cases.

3. **Verify interactions**: Use play functions to verify that interactions work correctly.

4. **Check accessibility**: Use the a11y addon to ensure accessibility is maintained.

5. **Test responsiveness**: Use the viewport addon to test responsive behavior.

## Automation for Story Creation

The project includes automation for creating story files:

```bash
node scripts/generate-story.js --component=ComponentName --type=atom --interactions --context=portfolio --detailed
```

This script generates a comprehensive story file with:
- Basic component rendering
- Controls for props
- Interaction tests
- Documentation templates
- Context integration if needed

## Guidelines for Communicating Component Changes

When making significant changes to components, follow these guidelines to communicate them effectively:

1. **Document changes**: Clearly document what has changed in the component and why.

2. **Highlight breaking changes**: If a change breaks existing usage, make this very clear.

3. **Update examples**: Provide updated usage examples for changed components.

4. **Use visual diffs**: When possible, include before/after screenshots to illustrate changes.

5. **Demonstrate in Storybook**: Use Storybook stories to demonstrate new features or changes.

6. **Tag stakeholders**: Ensure relevant team members are aware of significant changes.

By following this checklist and associated processes, we can maintain high-quality components with excellent documentation that are easy to use and maintain.
