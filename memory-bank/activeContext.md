# Active Context

## Current Focus
The developer portfolio project is focused on implementing the detailed component migration plan following the successful Storybook integration and Tailwind CSS migration. We're executing a systematic refactoring of all components using atomic design principles and resolving technical debt.

The implementation is progressing through phases:

1. **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete Projects, Experience, and Skills section migrations (COMPLETED)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Education, Feedbacks, Contact/Github, Navigation, and Footer migrations (CURRENT)
3. **Phase 3**: Add UI enhancements (modals, toasts, form components)
4. **Phase 4**: Implement accessibility and testing improvements
5. **Phase 5**: Finalize documentation and resolve technical debt

Our implementation approach is guided by these key principles:

1. **Atomic Design Implementation**: Creating a complete component library from atoms to pages
2. **Context API Integration**: Using context hooks for centralized state management
3. **Design Token System**: Maintaining consistent design through Tailwind CSS
4. **Performance Optimization**: Applying proper memoization and lazy loading techniques
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Building comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Recent Changes

### Repository Cleanup Completed
- Removed all Bootstrap-related files and references:
  - Cleaned up deprecated CSS files, backups, and vendor directories
  - Removed bootstrap references from vite.config.js
  - Removed bootstrap analysis and migration files
- Simplified build configuration:
  - Removed duplicate Jest configuration (jest.config.js)
  - Removed unused JSDoc configuration (jsdoc.json)
  - Removed redundant JSConfig file
  - Streamlined Vite configuration by removing unused plugins
- Updated documentation to reflect completed migrations

### Tailwind Migration Completed
- Successfully migrated from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS
- Removed all component-specific CSS files
- Implemented custom Tailwind utilities for component styling
- Updated all components to use Tailwind classes
- Documented new CSS architecture in component-css-guide.md

### Storybook Implementation Completed
- Successfully implemented Storybook with atomic design organization
- Created stories for all component levels (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- Built comprehensive documentation and testing within Storybook
- Implemented interaction tests and accessibility checks

### Component Migration Completed
- Completed Phase 1 implementation for all key sections:
  - Projects section (100% complete)
  - Experience section (100% complete)
  - Skills section (100% complete)
- All Phase 1 components now use Tailwind CSS
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Implemented performance optimizations

## Next Steps

Our current priorities are:

1. **Execute Phase 2 Implementation**:
   - Start refactoring Navigation & Footer components
   - Begin secondary content section migrations (Education, Feedbacks, Contact/Github)
   - Implement performance optimizations across all components

2. **Continue Technical Debt Reduction**:
   - Fix test configuration issues for ESM modules
   - Add test coverage for all refactored components
   - Implement performance monitoring tools

3. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Update guides to reflect new Tailwind architecture
   - Enhance component API documentation
   - Create detailed guides for component customization

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modern Build Configuration**: Using Vite for fast development
   - Approach: Simplified configuration with minimal plugins
   - Implementation: ESM-first approach with CommonJS compatibility for testing

2. **Testing Strategy**: Balancing unit, integration, and visual tests
   - Approach: Unit tests for all components, integration tests for key user flows
   - Implementation: Detailed testing patterns in component-testing-best-practices.md

3. **Performance Strategy**: Component-level optimizations
   - Approach: Targeted performance improvements rather than premature optimization
   - Implementation: Focus on animations, image loading, and expensive calculations

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Test Configuration Issues**: Resolving Jest configuration with ESM modules
   - Current Challenge: Test files having issues with module import syntax
   - Solution Path: Update babel configuration and mock implementation approach

2. **Responsive Testing**: Ensuring proper behavior across devices
   - Challenge: Comprehensive testing of responsive layouts
   - Solution: Viewport testing in Storybook and dedicated responsive test cases

## Current Implementation Status

### Projects Section (✅ 100% Complete)
- ✅ ProjectsCard.jsx refactored to use design tokens
- ✅ ProjectsCard CSS moved to Tailwind classes
- ✅ Projects container enhanced with loading states
- ✅ useProjects hook enhanced with validation and sorting
- ✅ Unit tests for ProjectsCard and Projects container
- ✅ Animation performance optimizations with hardware acceleration
- ✅ Empty state UI implementation
- ✅ Skeleton loading states implementation
- ✅ Integration tests for Projects section

### Experience Section (✅ 100% Complete)
- ✅ ExperienceCard Storybook component implemented
- ✅ ExperienceCard.jsx with complete Tailwind refactoring
- ✅ ExperienceCard animation performance optimizations
- ✅ Experience container refactoring with loading states
- ✅ useExperience hook enhancement with validation and sorting
- ✅ Skeleton loading implementation
- ✅ Empty state UI implementation
- ✅ Timeline display implementation with view toggle
- ✅ Unit tests for Experience components

### Skills Section (✅ 100% Complete)
- ✅ Skill.jsx component Storybook implementation
- ✅ Skill.jsx component refactored for Tailwind
- ✅ Icon handling with fallbacks implementation
- ✅ Skills container refactoring with loading states
- ✅ useSkills hook enhancement with validation and categorization
- ✅ Skeleton loading implementation
- ✅ Empty state UI implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive tests for all Skills components

## Technical Insights
- Skeleton loading patterns provide significant perceived performance improvements
- Using Tailwind's utilities for animations improves maintainability
- Memoizing animations configurations prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Vite provides faster development experience than traditional webpack setups
- Simplified build configuration reduces maintenance burden

## Technical Debt Addressed
1. **CSS Architecture**: ✅ Completed migration to Tailwind CSS
2. **Bootstrap Dependency**: ✅ Removed all Bootstrap files and references
3. **Build Configuration**: ✅ Simplified and optimized build tools

## Remaining Technical Debt
1. **Test Configuration**: Jest configuration needs updates to properly support ESM modules
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Need metrics to track performance improvements
3. **Type Checking**: Consider adding TypeScript or improving PropTypes validation
4. **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables for API keys and other configuration
