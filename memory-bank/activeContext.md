# Active Context

## Current Focus
The developer portfolio project is focused on implementing the detailed component migration plan following the successful Storybook integration. We're now executing a systematic refactoring of all components using atomic design principles.

The primary implementation focus is on completing the migration in phases as outlined in the `component-migration-plan.md`. This includes:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Complete Projects, Experience, and Skills section migrations
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Education, Feedbacks, Contact/Github, Navigation, and Footer migrations
3. **Phase 3**: Add UI enhancements (modals, toasts, form components)
4. **Phase 4**: Implement accessibility and testing improvements
5. **Phase 5**: Finalize documentation and resolve technical debt

Our implementation approach is guided by these key principles:

1. **Atomic Design Implementation**: Creating a complete component library from atoms to pages
2. **Context API Integration**: Using context hooks for centralized state management
3. **Design Token System**: Maintaining consistent design through CSS variables
4. **Performance Optimization**: Applying proper memoization and lazy loading techniques
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Building comprehensive test coverage and documentation

## Recent Changes

### Storybook Implementation Completed
- Successfully implemented Storybook with atomic design organization
- Created stories for all component levels (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
- Built comprehensive documentation and testing within Storybook
- Implemented interaction tests and accessibility checks
- Created detailed implementation summary in `docs/storybook-implementation-summary.md`

### Component Migration Started
- Created comprehensive component migration plan with phased approach
- Started implementation of Projects section refactoring:
  - Updated ProjectsCard component with design tokens and optimizations
  - Enhanced Projects container with loading states and context integration
  - Improved useProjects hook with validation and filtering capabilities
  - Created unit tests for refactored components
- Added skeleton loading states for better user experience

### Performance Enhancements
- Implemented useMemo for computed values to prevent unnecessary calculations
- Added proper event handler memoization with useCallback
- Applied will-change CSS property for optimized animations
- Improved responsive image handling with width/height/sizes attributes

### Documentation Improvements
- Updated progress tracking in memory-bank documents
- Created comprehensive component-migration-plan.md with timelines and tasks
- Added component testing documentation with practical examples
- Enhanced storybook documentation with usage guidelines

## Next Steps

Following our component-migration-plan.md, our current priorities are:

1. **Complete Phase 1 Implementation**: 
   - Finish Projects section refactoring (~85% complete)
   - Complete Skills section refactoring (~80% complete)
   - Add integration tests for Projects section
   - Add unit tests for Skills components
   
   The Experience section is now 100% complete with all features and tests implemented.

2. **Tech Debt Reduction**:
   - Resolve CSS organization issues by moving to component-specific files
   - Apply design tokens consistently across all components
   - Add test coverage for all refactored components

3. **Prepare for Phase 2**:
   - Plan Education section refactoring
   - Document preliminary approach for Feedbacks section
   - Create detailed implementation checklist for next phase

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Skeleton Loading**: Implementing skeleton loading states for better UX
   - Approach: Custom CSS animations with gradients instead of third-party libraries
   - Implementation: Component-specific skeleton loaders that match final UI

2. **Testing Strategy**: Balancing unit, integration, and visual tests
   - Approach: Unit tests for all components, integration tests for key user flows
   - Implementation: Detailed testing patterns in component-testing-best-practices.md

3. **Performance Strategy**: Component-level optimizations
   - Approach: Targeted performance improvements rather than premature optimization
   - Implementation: Focus on animations, image loading, and expensive calculations

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Test Configuration Issues**: Resolving Jest configuration with ESM modules
   - Current Challenge: Test files having issues with module import syntax
   - Solution Path: Update babel configuration and mock implementation approach

2. **CSS Architecture Transition**: Moving from section-based to component-based CSS
   - Challenge: Avoiding duplication while ensuring styles don't leak between components
   - Solution: Systematic CSS migration with design tokens as the source of truth

3. **Responsive Testing**: Ensuring proper behavior across devices
   - Challenge: Comprehensive testing of responsive layouts
   - Solution: Viewport testing in Storybook and dedicated responsive test cases

## Current Implementation Status

From our component-migration-plan.md:

### Projects Section (~85% Complete)
- ✅ ProjectsCard.jsx refactored to use design tokens
- ✅ ProjectsCard CSS moved to component-specific file
- ✅ Projects container enhanced with loading states
- ✅ useProjects hook enhanced with validation and sorting
- ✅ Unit tests for ProjectsCard and Projects container
- ✅ Animation performance optimizations with hardware acceleration

## Technical Insights
- Skeleton loading patterns provide significant perceived performance improvements
- Using CSS variables with will-change property improves animation performance
- Memoizing animations configurations prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Unit test configuration needs attention to support modern module syntax

## Technical Debt Identified
1. **Test Configuration**: Jest configuration needs updates to properly support ESM modules
2. **CSS Organization**: Some components still have styles spread across multiple files
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Need metrics to track performance improvements
4. **Type Checking**: Consider adding TypeScript or improving PropTypes validation
5. **Environment Configuration**: Environment variables for API keys and other configuration
