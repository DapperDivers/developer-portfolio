# Active Context

## Current Focus
The developer portfolio project is focused on implementing the detailed component migration plan following the successful Storybook integration and Tailwind CSS migration. We're executing a systematic refactoring of all components using atomic design principles and resolving technical debt.

The implementation is progressing through phases:

1. **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete Projects, Experience, and Skills section migrations (COMPLETED)
2. **Phase 2**: Implement Education, Feedbacks, Contact/Github, Navigation, and Footer migrations (CURRENT)
3. **Phase 3**: Add UI enhancements (modals, toasts, form components)
4. **Phase 4**: Implement accessibility and testing improvements
5. **Phase 5**: Finalize documentation and resolve technical debt

Our implementation approach is guided by these key principles:

1. **Atomic Design Implementation**: Creating a complete component library from atoms to pages
2. **Context API Integration**: Using context hooks for centralized state management
3. **Design Token System**: Maintaining consistent design through Tailwind CSS
4. **Performance Optimization**: Applying proper memoization and lazy loading techniques
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Building comprehensive test coverage and documentation

   - ✅ Complete Education section refactoring
   - ✅ Complete Feedbacks section refactoring
   - ✅ Complete Contact/Github section refactoring
   - Implement performance optimizations across all components

2. **Continue Technical Debt Reduction**:
   - ✅ Fix test configuration issues for ESM modules
   - ✅ Add test coverage for Navigation & Footer components
   - ✅ Add test coverage for Education components
   - ✅ Add test coverage for Feedbacks components
   - ✅ Add test coverage for Contact/Github components
   - ✅ Implement performance monitoring tools
   - ✅ Implement environment variable handling
   - ✅ Consolidate duplicated documentation
   - ✅ Implement improved type checking
   - ✅ Migrate from npm to Yarn package manager

3. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Update guides to reflect new Tailwind architecture
   - Enhance component API documentation
   - Create detailed guides for component customization
   - ✅ Establish clear boundaries between memory-bank and docs

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modern Build Configuration**: Using Vite for fast development
   - Approach: Simplified configuration with minimal plugins
   - Implementation: ESM-first approach with CommonJS compatibility for testing

2. **Testing Strategy**: Balancing unit, integration, and visual tests
   - Approach: Unit tests for all components, integration tests for key user flows
   - Implementation: Detailed testing patterns in component-testing-best-practices.md

3. **Performance Strategy**: Component-level optimizations
   - Approach: Targeted performance improvements rather than premature optimization
   - Implementation: Focus on animations, image loading, and expensive calculations

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Test Configuration Issues**: Resolving Jest configuration with ESM modules
   - Current Challenge: Test files having issues with module import syntax
   - Solution Path: Update babel configuration and mock implementation approach

2. **Responsive Testing**: Ensuring proper behavior across devices
   - Challenge: Comprehensive testing of responsive layouts
   - Solution: Viewport testing in Storybook and dedicated responsive test cases

## Technical Insights
- Skeleton loading patterns provide significant perceived performance improvements
- Using Tailwind's utilities for animations improves maintainability
- Memoizing animations configurations prevents unnecessary re-renders
- Vite provides faster development experience than traditional webpack setups
- Simplified build configuration reduces maintenance burden
- Performance monitoring tools help identify optimization opportunities:
  - FPS monitoring for animations provides concrete data on animation performance
  - Device capability detection allows adaptive experiences
  - Using performance marks and measures provides accurate timing information
  - Animation preference settings improve accessibility and performance

## Technical Debt Addressed

2. **Bootstrap Dependency**: ✅ Removed all Bootstrap files and references
3. **Build Configuration**: ✅ Simplified and optimized build tools
4. **Component Organization**: Implementing feature-based co-location of component files to improve developer experience

## Remaining Technical Debt
1. ~~**Test Configuration**: Jest configuration needs updates to properly support ESM modules~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. ~~**Performance Monitoring**: Need metrics to track performance improvements~~ ✅ COMPLETED
3. ~~**Environment Configuration**: Environment variables for API keys and other configuration~~ ✅ COMPLETED
4. ~~**Documentation Duplication**: Consolidate documentation and remove duplication between memory-bank and docs~~ ✅ COMPLETED
5. ~~**Type Checking**: Consider adding TypeScript or improving PropTypes validation~~ ✅ COMPLETED
6. **Component Organization**: Move component files (JSX, CSS, stories, tests) into component-specific directories

## Recent Initiatives

### Component Structure Reorganization
- Developed a migration plan to co-locate related component files
- Created reorganization script at `scripts/reorganize-component-structure.js`
- Added `reorganize-components` script to package.json
- Problem: Current structure has related component files spread across multiple directories
- Solution: Move to a feature-based organization where all component files are in one directory
- Benefits:
  - Easier maintenance (all files in one place)
  - Improved developer experience (less context switching)
  - Better component encapsulation
  - Simplified refactoring
- Documentation:
  - Added new `docs/component-organization.md` guide
  - Migration guide will be generated during reorganization
