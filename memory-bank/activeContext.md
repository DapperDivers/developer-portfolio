# Active Context

## Current Focus
The developer portfolio project is currently focused on implementing front-end best practices through a systematic refactoring effort. We are transforming the codebase according to the detailed implementation plan documented in the ai-docs folder, which includes:

1. **Front-End Best Practices Implementation Guide**: A comprehensive guide with code examples for each practice
2. **Implementation Steps Checklist**: A step-by-step plan with small, manageable tasks
3. **Component Migration Examples**: Before/after examples for migrating components
4. **Design System Specification**: Detailed design token specifications

Our implementation priorities are:

1. **Atomic Design Implementation**: Creating reusable base UI components following the atomic design methodology
2. **Context API Integration**: Moving from prop drilling to context-based state management
3. **Design Token System**: Implementing a comprehensive design system through CSS variables
4. **Performance Optimization**: Applying memoization, lazy loading, and intersection observer techniques
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Building robust test coverage and thorough component documentation

## Recent Changes

### Component Architecture
- Created foundational UI components (Button, Card, ResponsiveImage, etc.)
- Implemented layout components (Section) with consistent styling and behavior
- Started refactoring section-specific components to use these base components
- Added comprehensive PropTypes validation with JSDoc documentation
- Implemented consistent component APIs across the system

### State Management
- Implemented PortfolioContext provider for centralized data access
- Created feature-specific hooks (useProjects, useEducation, etc.)
- Reduced prop drilling through context usage

### CSS Architecture
- Implemented comprehensive design token system in design-tokens.css
- Created structured system for colors, typography, spacing, and other visual elements
- Created component-specific CSS files with consistent naming conventions
- Standardized CSS variable usage across component styles
- Organized CSS properties for consistency and maintainability

### Performance
- Added useIntersectionObserver hook for scroll-based optimizations
- Implemented React.memo for expensive components
- Added useCallback and useMemo optimizations
- Enhanced image loading with the ResponsiveImage component

## Next Steps
Following the incremental approach outlined in the ai-docs implementation plan, our upcoming priorities are:

1. **Complete Component Migration - One Section at a Time**:
   - Finish the Projects section refactoring completely
   - Move to Experience section refactoring
   - Continue systematic migration through all sections
   - This incremental approach ensures we can see results quickly while maintaining site functionality

2. **Enhance Performance**:
   - Apply React.memo systematically to expensive components
   - Implement useCallback for all event handlers
   - Apply useMemo for computed values
   - Optimize animation performance with will-change CSS property
   - Ensure all mapped elements have proper key attributes

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Add proper ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy throughout the site
   - Implement keyboard navigation support with visible focus states
   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (minimum 4.5:1)
   - Add skip to content functionality and test with screen readers

4. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Complete unit tests for all base UI components
   - Test component rendering, user interactions, and accessibility features
   - Implement integration tests for key user flows
   - Focus on critical components and edge cases

5. **Documentation**:
   - Complete JSDoc documentation with examples for all components
   - Document context providers and custom hooks
   - Create sample usage examples for all components
   - Update README with implementation approach and best practices

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Component Granularity**: Finding the right balance between atomic reusability and over-engineering
   - Current approach: Create base components for common UI patterns (Button, Card, Section), but avoid premature abstraction
   - Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms) while monitoring component complexity

2. **CSS Architecture**: Balancing flexibility, maintainability, and developer experience
   - Current decision: Comprehensive design token system via CSS variables with component-specific CSS files
   - Design token categories: Colors, Typography, Spacing, Borders, Shadows, Transitions, Breakpoints, Z-index
   - Standardized naming conventions for all CSS variables and class names

3. **Performance Strategy**: Balancing visual richness with performance
   - Current approach: Implement performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading) while maintaining visual appeal
   - Use performance metrics to guide optimization efforts

### Implementation Challenges
1. **Legacy Code Integration**: Managing the transition from existing code to new patterns
   - Approach: Incremental refactoring section by section following the implementation checklist
   - Focus on creating complete, working sections before moving to the next
   - Use before/after component examples as migration guides

2. **Component Consistency**: Ensuring consistent patterns across the application
   - Strategy: Establish clear component APIs with comprehensive PropTypes
   - Document components with JSDoc including usage examples
   - Use common patterns for props naming (variant, size, className, etc.)
   - Apply consistent event handling patterns across all interactive components

3. **Testing Balance**: Finding the right level of test coverage
   - Approach: Focus on testing complex logic and key user flows
   - Prioritize components with high reuse or complex behavior

## Technical Insights
- The atomic design approach is proving effective for component reusability
- Context API is sufficient for this project's state management needs
- CSS variables provide a good balance of flexibility and native support
- Intersection Observer is powerful for performance and animation triggers

## Key Questions To Address
1. How can we further optimize the performance of animations without sacrificing visual appeal?
2. What strategies should we employ to ensure consistent styling as the component library grows?
3. How do we balance documentation thoroughness with development velocity?
4. What metrics should we use to evaluate the success of our refactoring efforts?
