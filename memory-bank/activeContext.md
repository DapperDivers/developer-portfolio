# Active Context

## Current Focus
The developer portfolio project is currently focused on implementing front-end best practices through a systematic refactoring effort, now enhanced with Storybook integration for atomic design development. We are transforming the codebase according to the detailed implementation plan documented in the memory-bank folder, which includes:

1. **Front-End Best Practices Implementation Guide**: A comprehensive guide with code examples for each practice
2. **Implementation Steps Checklist**: A step-by-step plan with small, manageable tasks
3. **Component Migration Examples**: Before/after examples for migrating components
4. **Design System Specification**: Detailed design token specifications
5. **Testing Best Practices**: Guidelines for component testing documented in the testing folder
6. **Storybook Implementation**: Component library documentation and development environment

Our implementation priorities are:

1. **Atomic Design Implementation**: Creating reusable base UI components following the atomic design methodology, now supported by Storybook for isolated development
2. **Context API Integration**: Moving from prop drilling to context-based state management
3. **Design Token System**: Implementing a comprehensive design system through CSS variables, visualized in Storybook
4. **Performance Optimization**: Applying memoization, lazy loading, and intersection observer techniques
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Building robust test coverage and thorough component documentation with Storybook integration

## Next Steps
Following the incremental approach outlined in our implementation plans, our upcoming priorities are:

1. **Storybook Component Implementation**:
   - Follow the detailed checklist in `memory-bank/storybook-implementation-plan.md`
   - Complete remaining atomic components first (SkipToContent, Loading)
   - Implement remaining molecular components
   - Create organism-level stories for container components
   - Enhance design system documentation

2. **Component Migration - One Section at a Time**:
   - Finish the Projects section refactoring completely
   - Move to Experience section refactoring
   - Continue systematic migration through all sections
   - This incremental approach ensures we can see results quickly while maintaining site functionality

3. **Enhance Performance**:
   - Apply React.memo systematically to expensive components
   - Implement useCallback for all event handlers
   - Apply useMemo for computed values
   - Optimize animation performance with will-change CSS property
   - Ensure all mapped elements have proper key attributes

4. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Add proper ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy throughout the site
   - Implement keyboard navigation support with visible focus states
   - Ensure color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards (minimum 4.5:1)
   - Add skip to content functionality and test with screen readers

5. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Complete interaction tests for component stories
   - Add accessibility tests in Storybook
   - Complete unit tests for all base UI components
   - Implement integration tests for key user flows
   - Focus on critical components and edge cases

6. **Documentation**:
   - Complete JSDoc documentation with examples for all components
   - Document context providers and custom hooks
   - Create sample usage examples for all components
   - Update README with implementation approach and best practices

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Component Granularity**: Finding the right balance between atomic reusability and over-engineering
   - Current approach: Create base components for common UI patterns (Button, Card, Section), but avoid premature abstraction
   - Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms) while monitoring component complexity

2. **CSS Architecture**: Balancing flexibility, maintainability, and developer experience
   - Current decision: Comprehensive design token system via CSS variables with component-specific CSS files
   - Design token categories: Colors, Typography, Spacing, Borders, Shadows, Transitions, Breakpoints, Z-index
   - Standardized naming conventions for all CSS variables and class names

3. **Performance Strategy**: Balancing visual richness with performance
   - Current approach: Implement performance optimizations (memoization, lazy loading) while maintaining visual appeal
   - Use performance metrics to guide optimization efforts

### Implementation Challenges
1. **Legacy Code Integration**: Managing the transition from existing code to new patterns
   - Approach: Incremental refactoring section by section following the implementation checklist
   - Focus on creating complete, working sections before moving to the next
   - Use before/after component examples as migration guides

2. **Component Consistency**: Ensuring consistent patterns across the application
   - Strategy: Establish clear component APIs with comprehensive PropTypes
   - Document components with JSDoc including usage examples
   - Use common patterns for props naming (variant, size, className, etc.)
   - Apply consistent event handling patterns across all interactive components

3. **Testing Balance**: Finding the right level of test coverage
   - Approach: Focus on testing complex logic and key user flows
   - Prioritize components with high reuse or complex behavior

## Technical Insights
- The atomic design approach is proving effective for component reusability
- Context API is sufficient for this project's state management needs
- CSS variables provide a good balance of flexibility and native support
- Intersection Observer is powerful for performance and animation triggers

## Key Questions To Address
1. How can we further optimize the performance of animations without sacrificing visual appeal?
2. What strategies should we employ to ensure consistent styling as the component library grows?
3. How do we balance documentation thoroughness with development velocity?
4. What metrics should we use to evaluate the success of our refactoring efforts?
