## Current Status
The project is currently in the **Component Migration Phase**, following the incremental approach documented in the ai-docs folder. We're working through a systematic transformation of the codebase one section at a time.

### Implementation Approach Progress
Following the approach outlined in ai-docs/README.md:

1. âœ… **Project Structure Setup**: Complete (new folder structure established)
2. âœ… **Design System Foundation**: Complete (design tokens implemented)
3. âœ… **Base UI Component Creation**: Complete (Button, Card, Section, etc.)
4. âœ… **Core Utilities**: Complete (hooks, context)
5. ðŸ”„ **Component Migration - Projects Section**: In progress (~60% complete)
6. â¬œ **Component Migration - Other Sections**: Pending
7. â¬œ **Performance Optimizations**: Initial implementation, more work needed
8. â¬œ **Accessibility Improvements**: Initial planning, implementation pending
9. ðŸ”„ **Testing & Documentation**: Basic setup complete, front-end best practices documented, component documentation ongoing

### Current Sprint Focus
Based on the implementation steps checklist:

- Complete the Projects section refactoring
- Continue Experience and Skills section Storybook documentation and testing 
- Implement complete Context API integration for all sections
- Add comprehensive tests for refactored components
- Implement remaining Storybook components from implementation plan
- Continue to expand component documentation with JSDoc

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **CSS Organization**: Some CSS is still organized by section rather than by component
   - Impact: Medium - Makes styling changes more difficult
   - Resolution Plan: Migrate to component-specific CSS files and apply design tokens consistently

2. **Inconsistent Component Patterns**: Some components don't yet follow the atomic design patterns
   - Impact: Medium - Reduces consistency and maintainability
   - Resolution Plan: Continue systematic refactoring following component migration examples

3. **Limited Test Coverage**: Many components lack proper tests
   - Impact: High - Risk of regressions during refactoring
   - Resolution Plan: Add tests alongside component refactoring, prioritizing base components

### Bugs & Limitations
1. **Animation Performance**: Some animations may cause jank on slower devices
   - Impact: Low - Affects visual polish but not core functionality
   - Resolution Plan: Optimize animations with hardware acceleration and reduced complexity

2. **Responsive Layout Edge Cases**: Some sections may have issues at extreme viewport sizes
   - Impact: Low - Affects rare use cases
   - Resolution Plan: Enhance responsive testing and fixes

3. **GitHub API Rate Limiting**: Unauthenticated API requests may hit rate limits
   - Impact: Medium - Can affect GitHub section display
   - Resolution Plan: Implement authenticated requests or local data fallback

### Accessibility Gaps
1. **Keyboard Navigation**: Some interactive elements lack proper keyboard support
   - Impact: High - Affects users who navigate via keyboard
   - Resolution Plan: Implement comprehensive keyboard handlers

2. **Screen Reader Support**: Missing ARIA attributes in some components
   - Impact: High - Affects users with screen readers
   - Resolution Plan: Add proper ARIA attributes to all components
