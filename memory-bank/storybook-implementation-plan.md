# Storybook Implementation Plan

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for adding all components to Storybook following atomic design principles.

## 1. Infrastructure & Setup

- [x] Basic Storybook installation and configuration
- [x] Story generation script (`scripts/generate-story.js`)
- [x] Mock data utilities (`src/stories/utils/mockData.js`)

- [ ] Create guidelines for communicating component changes through Storybook

## Implementation Notes

### Best practices for story creation:
1. **Start with basic rendering**: Show the component in its default state
2. **Add variants**: Demonstrate different props and configurations
3. **Include edge cases**: Empty states, error states, loading states
4. **Add interaction tests**: Use play functions to verify behaviors
5. **Document thoroughly**: Provide clear descriptions and examples

### Context considerations:
- Use the `withPortfolioContext` decorator for components that need context
- For components with complex context needs, create specific context providers
- Document context dependencies clearly in each story

### Performance considerations:
- Use minimal animation in Storybook stories where possible
- For heavy animations, add controls to toggle animation on/off
- Document performance optimizations in component stories
