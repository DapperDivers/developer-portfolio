# Storybook Implementation

## Overview
Storybook has been integrated into the developer portfolio project to support atomic design development. This implementation provides an isolated environment for developing, testing, and documenting UI components.

## Implementation Details

### Core Structure
- **Configuration**:
  - `.storybook/main.js`: Core configuration with addons including a11y
  - `.storybook/preview.js`: Global parameters with viewport sizes, CSS imports, and decorators
  
- **Atomic Design Organization**:
  - `/src/stories/atoms/`: Basic UI components (Button, Card, Skill, LazyImage)
  - `/src/stories/molecules/`: Compound components (ExperienceCard, ProjectsCard)
  - `/src/stories/organisms/`: Complex section components (planned)
  - `/src/stories/templates/`: Layout components (Section)
  - `/src/stories/design-system/`: Design token documentation

### Features Implemented
1. **Advanced Documentation**:
   - Using `autodocs` tag to generate docs from PropTypes and JSDoc
   - Comprehensive prop tables with descriptions
   - Detailed markdown documentation with usage examples

2. **Interaction Testing**:
   - Step-by-step interaction tests with `play` functions
   - Visual state verification through snapshots
   - Simulated user actions (click, hover, keyboard navigation)

3. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Integrated a11y addon for accessibility checking
   - Component-specific a11y rule configurations
   - WCAG compliance verification

4. **Context Support**:
   - Mock data for PortfolioContext in `src/stories/utils/mockData.js`
   - Decorators for providing context in `src/stories/utils/decorators.jsx`
   - Context-aware component rendering

5. **Development Tooling**:
   - Enhanced story generator script at `scripts/generate-story.js`
   - Support for interactions, context, and detailed documentation 
   - Command-line flags for customizing story generation

### Utilities Created
1. **Mock Data**:
   - Comprehensive mock data for all context consumers
   - Example project data, skills, experience entries

2. **Decorators**:
   - Context providers for components that need context
   - Viewport simulators for responsive testing
   - Dark mode theme testing

3. **Generator Script**:
   - ES Module compatible script
   - Support for multiple component types
   - Customizable story templates

### Available Stories
- **Button**: Various variants, sizes, and states
- **Card**: Different configurations with header, footer, and content
- **Skill**: Different sizes and icon options
- **LazyImage**: Image loading states, aspect ratios, placeholders
- **ExperienceCard**: Professional experience display examples
- **ProjectsCard**: Project display with various layouts
- **Section**: Layout template for page sections
- **Design Tokens**: Visualization of the design system variables

## Usage Guide
A comprehensive guide has been created at `docs/storybook-guide.md` that includes:
- How to run and build Storybook
- Creating new component stories with our enhanced generator
- Best practices for story organization
- Using the generator script with all options
- Working with design tokens
- Testing components with Storybook
- Interaction testing patterns

## Implementation Progress

A detailed implementation plan is available at `memory-bank/storybook-implementation-plan.md` with complete checkboxes for tracking progress. The plan follows atomic design principles and includes all components structured by atomic design levels.
