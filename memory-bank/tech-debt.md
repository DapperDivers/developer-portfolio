# Technical Debt

This document tracks identified technical debt in the Developer Portfolio project. These issues should be addressed as part of the ongoing implementation according to their priority.

## High Priority

### 1. Test Configuration Issues

- **Problem**: Jest configuration has issues with ES Modules, causing test failures
- **Impact**: Prevents effective test creation and breaks existing tests
- **Solution**: Update Babel configuration and mock implementation approach
- **Steps**:
  - Review and update `babel.config.cjs` for proper ES Module handling
  - Fix mock implementations that use references to external variables
  - Update test imports to use consistent patterns
  - Document proper testing patterns for future development

### 2. CSS Architecture Transition âœ… COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Some components still have styles spread across section-based and component-specific CSS files
- **Impact**: Makes styling changes difficult and can cause unintended side effects
- **Solution**: Complete migration to Tailwind CSS from Bootstrap and component-specific CSS files
- **Completed**:
  - Migrated all styles to Tailwind CSS
  - Removed all component-specific CSS files
  - Consolidated styles in tailwind.css
  - Documented CSS organization in docs/guides/component-css-guide.md

### 3. Component Test Coverage

- **Problem**: Limited test coverage for many components
- **Impact**: High risk of regressions during refactoring
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive tests alongside component refactoring
- **Steps**:
  - Prioritize tests for base UI components
  - Add tests for key user flows
  - Implement accessibility tests
  - Document testing patterns

## Medium Priority

### 4. Performance Optimization

- **Problem**: Some animations may cause performance issues on slower devices
- **Impact**: Poor user experience on less powerful devices
- **Solution**: Optimize animations and implement performance monitoring
- **Steps**:
  - Add will-change CSS property where appropriate
  - Implement throttling for scroll-based animations
  - Use transform/opacity for animations
  - Add option to disable animations

### 5. Documentation Duplication

- **Problem**: Duplication between memory-bank files and docs directory
- **Impact**: Confusion and potential inconsistencies
- **Solution**: Consolidate documentation and create clear boundaries
- **Steps**:
  - Make memory-bank focused on implementation details and progress
  - Make docs focused on usage guides and examples
  - Remove duplication and clarify purpose of each document
  - Update documentation references

### 6. Storybook Implementation Files

- **Problem**: Storybook implementation plan is now complete but files remain
- **Impact**: Potential confusion about current status
- **Solution**: Archive implementation plan and focus on implementation summary
- **Steps**:
  - Mark storybook-implementation-plan.md as completed
  - Update storybook-implementation.md to reflect current status
  - Reference docs/storybook-implementation-summary.md as the source of truth

## Low Priority

### 7. Type Checking

- **Problem**: Limited type checking through PropTypes only
- **Impact**: Some type errors may not be caught until runtime
- **Solution**: Consider adding TypeScript or improving PropTypes validation
- **Steps**:
  - Evaluate benefits of adding TypeScript
  - If not using TypeScript, enhance PropTypes documentation
  - Add runtime validation for critical props
  - Document type checking approach

### 8. Environment Configuration

- **Problem**: Lack of environment variable handling for API keys
- **Impact**: Risk of hardcoded secrets or configuration issues
- **Solution**: Implement proper environment variable handling
- **Steps**:
  - Set up .env support with Vite
  - Document required environment variables
  - Add validation for required variables
  - Implement proper fallbacks

## Tracking Progress

Technical debt items should be addressed alongside feature development:

- **High Priority**: Address in Phase 1 of component migration plan
- **Medium Priority**: Address in Phase 3 of component migration plan
- **Low Priority**: Address in Phase 5 of component migration plan

As each item is addressed, update this document to reflect progress.
