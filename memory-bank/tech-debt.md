# Technical Debt

This document tracks identified technical debt in the Developer Portfolio project. These issues should be addressed as part of the ongoing implementation according to their priority.

## Completed Items

### 1. CSS Architecture Transition ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Some components had styles spread across section-based and component-specific CSS files
- **Solution**: Migrated to Tailwind CSS from Bootstrap and component-specific CSS files
- **Completed**:
  - Migrated all styles to Tailwind CSS
  - Removed all component-specific CSS files
  - Consolidated styles in tailwind.css
  - Documented CSS organization in docs/guides/component-css-guide.md

### 2. Bootstrap Migration and Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Bootstrap dependencies and related files were still present after migration
- **Solution**: Remove all Bootstrap-related files and references
- **Completed**:
  - Removed bootstrap-analysis.json
  - Removed bootstrap references from vite.config.js
  - Removed deprecated CSS files and directories
  - Cleaned up vendor directories
  - Removed Bootstrap fallback plugins

### 3. Build Configuration Cleanup ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Redundant build configuration files and unused config settings
- **Solution**: Streamline build configuration
- **Completed**:
  - Removed duplicate Jest config (jest.config.js)
  - Removed unused JSDoc config (jsdoc.json)
  - Removed minimal JSConfig (jsconfig.json) as paths are handled in vite.config.js
  - Simplified vite.config.js by removing unused plugins and references
  
### 4. Test Configuration Issues ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Jest configuration had issues with ES Modules, causing test failures
- **Solution**: Updated Babel configuration and mock implementation approach
- **Completed**:
  - Updated `babel.config.cjs` for proper ES Module handling
  - Fixed mock implementations that used references to external variables
  - Updated test imports to use consistent patterns
  - Documented proper testing patterns for future development

### 5. Performance Optimization ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Some animations caused performance issues on slower devices
- **Solution**: Optimized animations and implemented performance monitoring
- **Completed**:
  - Added will-change CSS property where appropriate
  - Implemented FPS monitoring for animations
  - Used transform/opacity for all animations
  - Added device capability detection
  - Added animation preference settings
  - Implemented performance mark/measure utilities

## High Priority

### 1. Component Test Coverage

- **Problem**: Limited test coverage for many components
- **Impact**: High risk of regressions during refactoring
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive tests alongside component refactoring
- **Steps**:
  - Prioritize tests for base UI components
  - Add tests for key user flows
  - Implement accessibility tests
  - Document testing patterns

## Medium Priority

### 1. Documentation Duplication ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Duplication between memory-bank files and docs directory
- **Impact**: Confusion and potential inconsistencies
- **Solution**: Consolidate documentation and create clear boundaries
- **Completed**:
  - ✅ Consolidated Storybook documentation (removed memory-bank/storybook-implementation.md)
  - ✅ Consolidated Component Testing Best Practices (removed duplicate in memory-bank)
  - ✅ Created comprehensive System Architecture documentation in docs/architecture
  - ✅ Enhanced Component Development Checklist with patterns from systemPatterns.md
  - ✅ Established clear purpose for memory-bank vs docs directories
  - ✅ Created README files explaining the role of each documentation directory

## Low Priority

### 1. Type Checking ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Limited type checking through PropTypes only
- **Impact**: Some type errors may not be caught until runtime
- **Solution**: Hybrid approach with TypeScript checking and enhanced PropTypes
- **Completed**:
  - Created comprehensive type-checking guide evaluating different approaches
  - Set up TypeScript in "check only" mode with tsconfig.json
  - Created type definitions for portfolio data
  - Implemented validation utility for runtime type checking
  - Added TypeScript checking script to build process
  - Enhanced PropTypes with validation utilities

### 2. Environment Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

- **Problem**: Lack of environment variable handling for API keys
- **Impact**: Risk of hardcoded secrets or configuration issues
- **Solution**: Implement proper environment variable handling
- **Completed**:
  - Created environment configuration utility (envConfig.js)
  - Set up .env support with dotenv
  - Created .env.example with documentation
  - Added validation for environment variables
  - Updated codebase to use central configuration
  - Created comprehensive environment configuration guide

## Tracking Progress

Technical debt items should be addressed alongside feature development:

- **High Priority**: Address in Phase 1 of component migration plan
- **Medium Priority**: Address in Phase 3 of component migration plan
- **Low Priority**: Address in Phase 5 of component migration plan

As each item is addressed, update this document to reflect progress.
