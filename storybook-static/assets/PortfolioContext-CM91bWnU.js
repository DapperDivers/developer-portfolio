Thus far I’ve instituted Azure Devops, automated deployments, unit testing, integration testing, selenium tests and a two-week sprint/release cadence to the organization. I’m currently leading the effort to modernize the tech stack, by methodically migrating the website from .NET 4.6.1 MVC Razor and AngularJS, to a microservices architecture with a react front end. This involves moving from AWS virtual machines to an ECS cluster, as well as migrating the current project to .NET Core while ensuring no downtime and adding new features.

' Derek was a dependable developer that always accomplished the task assigned even in the midst of changing business requirements and priorities.  He was quick to learn new technologies, such as languages, servers, cloud platforms, orchestration systems, and the like. This was despite Derek being from a .NET Windows development environment. He was able to learn PHP Laravel, Python, Debian Linux systems and IOT devices in short order. Derek  was an asset to my team. He was always self-motivated and willing to assist with any project. Along with being a top notch developer, he had strong communication and interpersonal skills. While working with Derek I assigned him many tasks with different scopes and technologies and he was able to learn what was needed and produce a working solution in a minimal timeframe.  I enjoyed working with him and would happily work with him in the future.
